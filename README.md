# Champlain Examen Application
A JavaFX app that creates an exam page which reads the files `tfq.txt` and `mcq.txt` and builds the questions. <br >
The user can then submit his answers for the questions and get their grade in return.

# About App
This application was made for my Java OOP class
## Future Functions
The majority of these functions are purely cosmetic as they were extras to my project, but I wish in the future to be able to work on them.
### To Work on
- Clear button: Reset the user's submitted answers on the exam page.
- Save button: Save the user's submitted answers into a .txt file.
- Quiz -> Settings: Change the background color of the application with an RGB wheel.
